            <h2 id="pg2">Biography</h2>
            <p>Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman,
                investor and co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pixar
                Animation Studios until it was bought by The Walt Disney Company. He was the largest shareholder at
                Disney and a member of Disney's Board of Directors. He was seen as a leading figure in both the
                computer and entertainment industries. In August 2011, Jobs resigned, and was appointed Chairman of
                Apple. He served in that position until he died, at the age of 56, on October 5, 2011 from
                complications
                of pancreatitis related to type 1 diabetes and metastatic insulinoma. Steve Jobs had type 1 diabetes
                as
                a child and had problems with insulin when he died.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc., was a college dropout who epitomized the power of
                self-directed learning and innovation. Born in 1955, Jobs enrolled at Reed College but dropped out after
                just one semester due to financial constraints. Despite leaving formal education, he audited creative
                classes, including calligraphy, which later influenced the design and aesthetics of Apple products.
                Jobs' unconventional educational journey didn't deter his passion for technology. Alongside Steve
                Wozniak, he founded Apple in 1976, revolutionizing the computer industry. Jobs' relentless pursuit of
                excellence, combined with his ability to blend technology and design, contributed to the creation of
                iconic products like the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His success serves as a testament to the
                idea that innovation and vision can often transcend traditional educational paths.

            <h2>Apple</h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976. The company's
                first product was the Apple I, a single-board computer designed by Wozniak. Jobs played a crucial
                role in marketing and promoting the product. The success of the Apple II in 1977 marked a turning
                point for the company, leading to significant financial growth.

                In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, a groundbreaking personal computer with a graphical user
                interface. However, internal conflicts led to Jobs' departure from Apple in 1985. He went on to
                found NeXT Computer and Pixar Animation Studios.

                Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 when the company acquired NeXT. His leadership brought about a
                remarkable turnaround, with the introduction of iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and
                iPad. Jobs' emphasis on design, innovation, and user experience defined Apple's identity. His legacy
                continues to shape the technology industry, and Apple remains a global leader in consumer
                electronics. Jobs' visionary approach and relentless pursuit of excellence left an indelible mark on
                both Apple and the tech world.
